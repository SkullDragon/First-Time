# First-Time

Practicing git for the first time!

## **Step 1**: Cloning and saving commits locally

Cloned repository to local machine/windows desktop.
Saving these changes locally.

## **Step 2**: Saving new files made locally into git

Created new file index.html.

Used git add to track the file(s) made locally.
-git add fileName or git add . or git add *.extension

Used git commit to save the changes.
-git commit alone directs you to another page to write the messages, to exit do 'esc :wq'
-git commit -m "" -m "" allows you to do a commit and create the decriptions for each commit; the first message is the general message while the second one is for the more in depth description
